# Hi there!

I'm a PhD researcher at the Department of Political Science at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, working at the Chair of Comparative Politics. My work focuses on how small states and self-governing non-sate territories democratise differently than other states, and what we can learn from this more broadly in the democratisation research.

You can find more about my PhD project here and my academic resume here.
