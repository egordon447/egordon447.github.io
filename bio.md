# About myself
I’m a third year PhD researcher Department of Political Science at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, working at the Chair of Comparative Politics. My PhD project focuses on the systemic exclusion of small states and self-governing non-state territories from the democratisation literature, and how we can learn important lessons, both substantively and methodologically, from examining them. 

Before relocating from New Zealand to Germany in 2020, I completed my bachelors, honours and master’s degrees in Political Science and International Relations at the University of Canterbury.  Where my master’s thesis examined how small states can punch above their weight to be more effective in their involvement in the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Alongside my master’s and PhD I completed a Graduate Diploma in Arts with an Economics endorsement from Massey University.
